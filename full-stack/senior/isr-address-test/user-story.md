# User Story
As an ISR, I would like a web application that I can upload the lead list given to me by my manager, and if I made one, my own separate lead list that as well.  

After uploading, I would like to receive a combined list of all my leads that are ordered in a way that makes my travel the most efficient.  

I will always be starting from my home so I should be able to enter my address as the starting location.

I want this so that I can spend as little time commmuting as possible and visit as many leads as possible.


# Business Context
ISRs are sales people who visit leads within their sales territory looking for equipment to sell in our online auctions.  Every week, a sales manager will generate a list of leads for each ISR and give it to him as a CSV.  Additionally, each ISR may generate their own lead list in the same CSV format.



# Stakeholders
* Approximately 100 ISRs (sales people) and sales managers.
