# User Story
As an ISR, I would like a web application that I can upload the lead list given to me by my manager, and if I made one, my own separate lead list as well.  

After uploading, I would like to receive a combined list of all my leads.  They should be ordered so that I visit all the leads with the shortest total commute distance. 

I will always be starting from my home so I should be able to enter my address as the starting location.

# Business Context
ISRs are sales people who visit leads within their sales territory looking for equipment to sell in our online auctions.  Every week, a sales manager will generate a list of leads for each ISR and give it to him as a CSV.  Additionally, each ISR may generate their own lead list in the same CSV format.

This application will help reduce the mileage costs incurred by bigiron and help ISRs plan the order they visit their leads in.

# Assumptions
* The value of each each lead is about the same.
* All leads are home all the time.  There is no need to call ahead or schedule a visit.

# Stakeholders
* Approximately 100 ISRs (sales people; interested in visiting all of their leads in an optimal way)
* Sales managers 
* Finance team (interested in reducing mileage spend)
