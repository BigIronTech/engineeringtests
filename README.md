# Engineering Tests

This repository holds the take-home tests for various positions inside of BigIron.   If you are here, you have likely made it past the screening interviews and are in the later stages of the interview process.  We're excited that you've made it this far.

At this stage in the interview process, we want to gain a deeper understanding of your work and give you the opportunity to show off your technical skills & knowledge.  To that end, we are requesting that you choose a take-home exercise and complete it.


## Time box

You should spend no more than four hours on the exercise in total.  We understand that this may not be enough time to adhere to your normal standards of quality.  Please add comments to the code explaining where you cut corners, why you decided to cut that corner and how you would do things differently if you had more time.

The small time box provides you with the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to prioritize functional and non-functional requirements inside of a tight business deadline.

## AI

Please do not use AI (including co-pilot) to complete any part of this exercise.  If we determine you used AI then you will be disqualified from consideration.  This is an opportunity to demonstrate your technical skill, not you skill at prompt engineering.

## Scoring & Evaluation

These exercises are NOT pass/fail and are not evaluated on a single metric.  We are looking at dozens of criteria, including how you break down and prioritize high level user stories into software, architecture, code quality, performance, maintainability, observability and more.

# Submission Instructions

1. Choose a test in a directory that matches the position and seniority that you are applying for.
2. Read the user-story.md file in that directory.
3. Send any questions to michael.mccann@bigiron.com
4. Complete the coding exercise within the time box described earlier.
5. When complete, create a new private repository, upload all deliverables to it and invite michael.mccann@bigiron.com to the repository that you created.
6. Email michael.mccann@bigiron.com with a link to the repository.  We'll get right on it and send you feedback as soon as we can.

# Submission Notes
* Only the head of your repository's main branch will be evaluated - you are welcome to do as many commits, PRs and create as many branches as you desire. 
* No changes will be considered after we have cloned the repository for evaluation.

# Tech Stack
Our tech stack is: C#, ASP.NET MVC, React, Tanstack, JQuery, Razor/Blazor pages, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, MSSQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, ShadCN, Redis & ElasticSearch.  We prefer REST over RPC and SOAP.

We strongly recommend building your example project using appropriate items from our tech stack but this is not a strict requirement.
  
# Specific deliverables for all tests
* Please include **at least one unit or integration test** in your project.  Please leave a comment explaining if it is a unit test or an integration test.
* **The project** itself with all source code, data & anicllary files needed to run the project locally.
* A **readme.md** file with documetation at level that you would include for any greenfield project.  Write it with the intent that you are handing off the project to a team of unknown skill and experience.
* A **roadmap.md** file describing what you would do if you were spending another 2 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks on this project.
* A **userdoc.md** file explaining how to use the software you've created.  Write it for the users described in the user-story.md file.  Be sure to notate any areas where corners were cut and how users can work around them to be successful.
* A **feedback.md** file sharing your general thoughts and feeling on the test.
